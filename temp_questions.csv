274,8.B,261,"8.C Characteristic and Minimal Polynomials  The Cayley-Hamilton Theorem The next definition associates a polynomial with each operator on $V$ if $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{C}$. For $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{R}$, the corresponding definition will be given in the next chapter. 8.34 Definition characteristic polynomial  Suppose $V$ is a complex vector space and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Let $\lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{m}$ denote the distinct eigenvalues of $T$, with multiplicities $d_{1}, \ldots, d_{m}$. The polynomial \[ \left(z-\lambda_{1}\right)^{d_{1}} \cdots\left(z-\lambda_{m}\right)^{d_{m}} \] is called the characteristic polynomial of $T$. 8.35 Example Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{C}^{3}\right)$ is defined as in Example 8.25. Because the eigenvalues of $T$ are $6$, with multiplicity $2$, and $7$, with multiplicity $1$, we see that the characteristic polynomial of $T$ is $(z-6)^{2}(z-7)$. 8.36 Degree and zeros of characteristic polynomial  Suppose $V$ is a complex vector space and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Then (a) the characteristic polynomial of $T$ has degree $\operatorname{dim} V$; (b) the zeros of the characteristic polynomial of $T$ are the eigenvalues of $T$.  Proof Clearly part (a) follows from $8.26$ and part (b) follows from the definition of the characteristic polynomial.  Most texts define the characteristic polynomial using determinants (the two definitions are equivalent by 10.25). The approach taken here, which is considerably simpler, leads to the following easy proof of the CayleyHamilton Theorem. In the next chapter, we will see that this result also holds on real vector spaces (see 9.24). 8.37 Cayley-Hamilton Theorem  Suppose $V$ is a complex vector space and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$.
